# Advent of Code 2021 Visualisations

This branch contains my attempts to make a somewhat pleasant looking visualisation (such as a graph or a video) for each day of Advent of Code 2021. I have removed the "no imports" target present for the main solutions in order to make the goal at least somewhat attainable.

*Note: Some visualisations may only show a small portion of the provided input data.*
