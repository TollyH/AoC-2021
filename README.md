# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions written in Python. I am attmepting to solve every day without any external help, and, for an additional challenge, do it without importing any libraries unless absolutely necessary.

I am not including my puzzle input with the solutions, as they should work with anyone's (it looks for it in a file called `input.txt` in the same folder as the script).
