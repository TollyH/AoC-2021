# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions written in Python - they are not necessarily the optimal solutions, nor are they necessarily particularly well written, as long as they give the correct answer in a bearable amount of time, they're good enough for me. I am attmepting to solve every day without any external help, and, for an additional challenge, do it without importing any libraries unless absolutely necessary.

I am not including my puzzle input with the solutions, as they should work with anyone's (it looks for it in a file called `input.txt` in the same folder as the script).
