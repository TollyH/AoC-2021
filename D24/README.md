# Note About Day 24

After a lot of blank staring, internal screaming, and failed brute-force attempts, I ended up solving Day 24 manually as opposed to using a code-based method. This means that there is no input independent solution here for today, so instead I've uploaded both my raw puzzle input as well as my annotated puzzle input that I wrote to whilst solving the puzzle. While I haven't created an input independent *solution*, I have at least created a script that will validate an inputted model number by using the MONAD program in any valid `input.txt` file (only MONAD programs will work, not any ALU program).
